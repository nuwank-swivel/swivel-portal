- **UI Components**: Complete (Calendar, Modals, Layouts)
- **Routing**: Basic setup complete
- **Authentication**: Not Started (MSAL.js integration pending)
- **API Integration**: Not Started

## Backend

- **API Endpoints**: Not Started
- **Authentication**: Not Started (Token validation logic pending)
