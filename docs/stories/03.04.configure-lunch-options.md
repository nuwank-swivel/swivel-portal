# Story 03.04: Configure Lunch Options

- **Status**: Draft
- **Epic**: Admin Features

## Story

**As an** admin,
**I want** to configure the available lunch options,
**so that** I can customize the choices available to employees when they book a seat.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. An admin can view the current list of lunch options.
2. An admin can add new lunch options to the list.
3. An admin can remove existing lunch options from the list.
4. The updated lunch options are reflected in the booking modal for all users.
5. Non-admin users cannot access this configuration.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Frontend:**
  - [ ] In the admin settings area, create a UI for managing the list of lunch options (e.g., a text field to add new ones, and a list with delete buttons for existing ones).
  - [ ] The booking modal should fetch the list of lunch options to populate the selection field.
- [ ] **Backend:**
  - [ ] Create an API endpoint `GET /api/lunch-options` to fetch the list of lunch options. This can be a public endpoint.
  - [ ] Create an API endpoint `PUT /api/lunch-options` to update the entire list of lunch options. This must be an admin-only endpoint.
  - [ ] Store the list of lunch options in the `seatConfigurations` collection or a dedicated collection.

## Dev Notes

- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/lunch-options`
  - `PUT /api/lunch-options`
- **Request Body for PUT:**
  ```json
  {
    "options": ["Packed Lunch", "Office Catering", "No Lunch"]
  }
  ```
- **Data Storage:** Storing this as an array of strings in the `seatConfigurations` document is likely sufficient.
- **Relevant Files:**
  - `apps/swivel-portal/src/pages/AdminSettings.tsx`
  - `apps/swivel-portal/src/components/booking/BookingModal.tsx`
  - `apps/swivel-portal-api/`

### Testing

- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test the GET and PUT endpoints for lunch options.
  - Verify that the PUT endpoint is protected from non-admin access.
- **E2E Tests:**
  - Simulate an admin updating the lunch options, and then a regular user opening the booking modal to see the new options.
