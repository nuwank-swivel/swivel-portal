# Story 07.01: Manage User Availability (Signin/Signoff & AFK)

- **Status**: Approved
- **Epic**: User Availability & Presence

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to manage my daily availability (signin, signoff, AFK, back) from the dashboard,
**So that** my presence and status are accurately reflected in the system and in Microsoft Teams.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new "Availability" section is visible on the user dashboard.

2. Users see "Signin" and "AFK" buttons:

   - "Signin" button starts the day, records signin time, and changes to "Signoff."
   - "AFK" button allows users to set an ETA (default 1 hour, customizable), changes to "Back" when active.
   - "Back" button resets presence/status.

3. Each action (Signin, AFK, Back, Signoff) sends a request to the backend:

   - Backend updates Teams availability and status message via Graph API.
   - All events are stored in the database.

4. Admins see an "Availability" button in their dashboard:

   - Can view todayâ€™s availability records for all users.
   - Can select a date to view historical records.

5. All availability events (signin, afk, back, signoff) are logged and retrievable by date.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Frontend:**
  - [ ] Add "Availability" section to dashboard for all users.
  - [ ] Implement "Signin", "Signoff", "AFK", and "Back" button logic and UI states.
  - [ ] Allow users to set and edit AFK ETA (default 1 hour).
  - [ ] Display current status and times for each event.
  - [ ] Admin dashboard: add "Availability" button and date selector to view records.
- [ ] **Backend:**
  - [ ] Create API endpoints for availability events (signin, signoff, afk, back).
  - [ ] Integrate with Microsoft Graph API to update Teams presence/status.
  - [ ] Store all events in the database and allow querying by date/user.
  - [ ] Admin endpoint to retrieve availability records for any date.

## Dev Notes

- AFK ETA is editable before confirming.
- Status changes are reflected in Teams automatically.
- UI should clearly show current state and times for each event.
- All events must be stored and retrievable for reporting/audit purposes.
