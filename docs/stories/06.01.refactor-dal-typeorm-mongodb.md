# Story 06.01: Refactor DAL to use TypeORM for MongoDB

- **Status**: Done
- **Epic**: Data Access Layer Modernization

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** the data access layer (`libs/dal`) to use TypeORM for MongoDB,
**so that** we can standardize data access, improve maintainability, and enable advanced querying features.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All data access logic in `libs/dal` uses TypeORM for MongoDB.
2. MongoDB connection is established and managed via TypeORM configuration.
3. All existing DAL tests pass after migration.
4. Documentation for DAL usage is updated to reflect TypeORM integration.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Update project dependencies to include TypeORM and its MongoDB support.
- [x] Refactor existing DAL models/entities to TypeORM entities.
- [x] Implement MongoDB connection logic using TypeORM configuration.
- [x] Migrate all DAL methods to use TypeORM APIs.
- [x] Update or add tests to cover the new DAL implementation.
- [x] Update documentation for DAL usage and setup.
- [x] Implement a base repository class for common CRUD operations.
- [x] Create entity-specific repository classes that extend the base repository.

## Dev Notes

- Use TypeORM's MongoDB driver and connection options.
- Ensure compatibility with existing application logic and APIs.
- Review TypeORM documentation for MongoDB-specific features and limitations.
- Follow the repository pattern: create a base repository for CRUD operations and entity-specific repositories for business logic and queries.

### Testing

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test DAL methods for correct data access and manipulation using TypeORM.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Test MongoDB connection and DAL integration with the rest of the application.
- **E2E Tests:**
  - Validate that application features relying on DAL work as expected after migration.
