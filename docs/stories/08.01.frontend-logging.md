# 08.01.frontend-logging: Add Logging to Key Frontend Actions and Error States

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to implement logging at critical points in the frontend application,  
**So that** we can monitor user actions, capture errors, and improve troubleshooting and analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Logging is added to major user actions (e.g., sign-in, booking creation, booking cancellation, navigation events).
2. Errors and exceptions are logged with relevant context (e.g., API failures, UI errors).
3. Logs include timestamps, user identifiers (where available), and action/error details.
4. Logging does not expose sensitive information (e.g., passwords, personal data).
5. Logs are accessible via the browser console in development and sent to a centralized logging service (if configured) in production.
6. Logging code is covered by unit tests where applicable.

## Notes

- Review existing code for places where logging is missing or insufficient.
- Use a consistent logging utility or pattern across the codebase.
- Coordinate with backend logging for end-to-end traceability.
