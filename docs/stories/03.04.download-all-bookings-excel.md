# Story 4.3: Download All Bookings as Excel

- **Status**: Approved
- **Epic**: Admin Features

## Story

**As an** admin,
**I want** to download the current list of bookings as an Excel file from the AllBookings modal,
**so that** I can easily analyze or share booking data offline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the AllBookings modal is open and the booking list is loaded, a "Download as Excel" button is visible in the top right corner of the modal.
2. Clicking the button downloads the currently displayed booking list as an Excel (.xlsx) file.
3. The Excel file contains all columns and rows as shown in the modal, including user name, duration type, meal type, and any other visible fields.
4. The filename includes the selected date (e.g., `bookings-2025-10-14.xlsx`).
5. The feature is only available to admin users.
6. The download works for any date selected in the modal.
