# Story 04.01: UI Refactor to Mantine

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to refactor the Swivel Portal UI to use Mantine UI,
**so that** the application is modernized and easier to maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  All existing UI components are replaced with their Mantine UI equivalents.
2.  The application's look and feel is updated to be consistent with the Mantine design system.
3.  Existing functionality remains unchanged.
4.  The seat booking page uses the Mantine `DatePicker` component for selecting dates.
5.  Reusable components are extracted and used across the application.
6.  All libraries are updated to their latest stable versions, including React 19.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Install and configure Mantine UI** (AC: 1, 6)
  - [ ] Add `@mantine/core`, `@mantine/hooks`, and other necessary Mantine packages to `apps/swivel-portal/package.json`.
