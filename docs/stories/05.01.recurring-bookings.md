# Story 05.01: Recurring Bookings (Roaster Support)

- **Status**: Draft
- **Epic**: Booking Automation

## Story

**As an** employee,
**I want** to set recurring days for automatic seat bookings (e.g., every Monday/Thursday),
**so that** I can reserve my preferred workspace on a regular schedule without manual booking each time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The user can select recurring days (e.g., Mon/Thu) in the booking UI.
2. The system automatically creates bookings for the selected days, subject to seat availability.
3. The user can view, update, or cancel recurring bookings.
4. The user can still book extra days outside their recurring schedule.
5. Recurring bookings are stored in the database and reflected in the user's booking list.
6. The system prevents double-booking for the same day.
