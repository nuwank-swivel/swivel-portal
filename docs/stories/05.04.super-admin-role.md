# Story 05.04: Super Admin Role (Entra ID Group)

- **Status**: Draft
- **Epic**: User Roles & Permissions

## Story

**As a** super admin,
**I want** to manage advanced settings and permissions via Entra ID group integration,
**so that** I can control system-wide configurations and access for other users.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Super admins have access to advanced admin features (e.g., team management, meal settings).
3. Only users in the Entra ID super admin group can access these features.
4. Super admin permissions are enforced in both frontend and backend.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Conditionally render super admin UI components based on role.
- [ ] **Backend:**
  - [ ] Integrate Entra ID group checks in authorization logic.
  - [ ] Protect super admin API endpoints.

## Dev Notes
